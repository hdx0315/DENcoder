# DENcoder - Decoder & Encoder

DENcoder is a simple desktop application that allows you to encode and decode messages using a user-provided or automatically generated private key. It is built using Python and Tkinter for the GUI.

### The application supports two modes:

- Encode: Converts a plain text message into an encoded format using the provided key.
- Decode: Decodes an encoded message back into its original form using the same key.


### Features
1. Strong Key Generation: A random strong key is generated by default for encoding/decoding.
2. Base64 Encoding: The message is encoded into a safe format that can be easily transmitted or stored.
3. Message History: Keeps track of the last 10 encode/decode operations.
4. GUI Interface: Easy-to-use graphical interface built with Tkinter.


### Installation
#### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- The following Python libraries:
    - tkinter (comes bundled with Python)
    - secrets
    - string
    - base64

```

### How to Use
- Enter a Message: In the "MESSAGE" field, input the message you want to encode or decode.
- Enter/Generate a Key: You can provide your own key or use the randomly generated key. The key is essential for both encoding and decoding the message.
- Select Mode: Choose whether to Encode or Decode from the drop-down.
- Click "RESULT": The encoded/decoded result will be shown in the result field.
Check History: A history of the last 10 encoding/decoding operations is displayed in the history panel.
- RESET: Clears all fields and generates a new key.
- EXIT: Closes the application.
